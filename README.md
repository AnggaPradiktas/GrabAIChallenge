Computer Vision on Predicting Car Feature
How might we automate the process of recognizing the details of the vehicles from images, including make and model?

## Problem Statement
Given a dataset of distinct car images, can you automatically recognize the car model and make?

## Dataset
We use the Cars Dataset, which contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars. The Cars dataset contains 16,185 images of 196 classes of cars. The data is split into 8,144 training images and 8,041 testing images, where each class has been split roughly in a 50-50 split. Classes are typically at the level of Make, Model, Year, e.g. 2012 Tesla Model S or 2012 BMW M3 coupe.
